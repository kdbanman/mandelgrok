### TODO

- animate plotSeq with MRU list of MandelSeq rather than CSS alpha hacks
    - DONT tweak colors yet, wait until the set is rendered.  that will be more important
    - mousemove based
        - each position in queue has static display props
        - queue positions dynamically filled

- render mandelbrot set under animation
    - use sequence properties for visual rep (research signal analysis)
        - visual diff should correspond to diff seq nature
        - seq properties are ideally computed as the sequence is generated

- tweak sequence render colors
    - c value
    - z
    - age

- parametrize with global max/min variables

- control max/min with mousewheel
