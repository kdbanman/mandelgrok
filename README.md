### TODO

- animate plotSeq with MRU list of MandelSeq rather than CSS alpha hacks
    - mousemove based
        - each position in queue has static display props
        - queue positions dynamically filled

- render mandelbrot set under animation
    - use sequence properties for visual rep (research signal analysis)
        - visual diff should correspond to diff seq nature
        - seq properties are ideally computed as the sequence is generated

- parametrize with global max/min variables

- control max/min with mousewheel
