### TODO

- animate with MRU list of MandelSeq rather than CSS alpha hacks

- render mandelbrot set under animation
    - use sequence properties for visual rep (research signal analysis)
        - visual diff should correspond to diff seq nature
        - seq properties are ideally computed as the sequence is generated

- parametrize with global max/min variables

- control max/min with mousewheel
