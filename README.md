### TODO

- fullheight square div for plot

- vertical fullheight, remaining width for dist plot

- animate with MRU list of MandelSeq rather than CSS alpha hacks

- render mandelbrot set under animation
    - use sequence properties for visual rep
        - visual diff should correspond to diff seq nature
        - seq properties are ideally computed as the sequence is generated
